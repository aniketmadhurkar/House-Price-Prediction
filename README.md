# House Price Prediction - Advanced Regression

This project aims to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques on a real-world dataset. The objective is to build a model that accurately estimates the value of homes based on various features like location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices. We explore several regression algorithms and evaluate their performance on the dataset. Feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation are key aspects of this project.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features and selected important ones to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:** Implemented multiple regression models, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - XGBoost
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the models using evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features related to house properties such as:
- **Numerical features:** Area (sq ft), number of rooms, year built, etc.
- **Categorical features:** Location, type of house, etc.

The dataset can be accessed from [Kaggle's House Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) or similar sources.



### Results
The model performance is evaluated using various regression metrics:
#### Best RMSE: 0.1201
#### Best MAE: 0.0893
#### R-squared Score: 0.87
#### Detailed analysis and results can be found in the final report.

## Technologies Used
#### Python
#### Pandas
#### NumPy
#### Scikit-learn
#### Matplotlib
#### Seaborn
#### XGBoost
## Future Work
Hyperparameter tuning for further model optimization.
Integration of deep learning models.
Deployment of the model as a web application.
